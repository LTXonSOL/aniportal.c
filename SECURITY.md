# SECURITY POLICY

## 1. Introduction

AniPortal.Live operates under the strictest possible security and compliance standards.  
The integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our platform, infrastructure, and data are considered non-negotiable.  
Every contributor, contractor, and user of AniPortal.Live is expected to follow this policy without exception.  
Any deviation from this policy will result in immediate suspension, termination, or legal action.

AniPortal.Live treats all digital assets ‚Äî including but not limited to source code, media files, API endpoints, and configuration data ‚Äî as **classified assets**.  
This document defines the mandatory rules, responsibilities, and enforcement mechanisms that protect those assets.

Security is not optional. It is mandatory, continuous, and absolute.

## 2. Scope of Application

This policy applies to:

- All websites, subdomains, APIs, and digital services under `aniportal.live`.
- All repositories, codebases, and hosted applications owned or operated by AniPortal.Live.
- All developers, system administrators, content managers, and contributors.
- All servers, endpoints, and cloud environments hosting AniPortal systems.
- Any third-party integration, service, or dependency interacting with AniPortal infrastructure.

This policy is global, permanent, and binding under the terms of AniPortal‚Äôs operational agreements.

## 3. Security Governance

### 3.1 Leadership

The AniPortal Security Division (APSD) has full authority to:
- Restrict, suspend, or terminate system access.
- Modify or revoke developer credentials at any time.
- Audit any account or device connected to AniPortal systems.

### 3.2 Mandatory Security Principles
Every participant must follow the **Five Core Security Principles**:

1. **Confidentiality** ‚Äì No data shall be exposed to unauthorized entities.  
2. **Integrity** ‚Äì All data must remain accurate, verifiable, and tamper-proof.  
3. **Availability** ‚Äì Systems must remain operational under all conditions.  
4. **Accountability** ‚Äì Every action must be traceable to an authenticated identity.  
5. **Non-repudiation** ‚Äì No user shall deny actions performed under their account.

Failure to adhere to any of these principles constitutes a major security violation.

## 4. Responsible Disclosure

AniPortal.Live maintains a **strict and structured vulnerability disclosure program**.

### 4.1 Reporting
If you identify a vulnerability, you must report it **privately and immediately**.

- Contact: **security@aniportal.live**
- Subject: `Security Report: [Short Description]`
- Include: Full technical details, proof of concept, affected endpoints, and impact summary.

Under no circumstances should vulnerabilities be publicly disclosed or shared with third parties before receiving written approval from the AniPortal Security Division.

### 4.2 Response Timeline
- Acknowledgment: within **48 hours**.  
- Verification and triage: within **7 days**.  
- Patch and deployment: within **30 days**, depending on severity.

### 4.3 Legal Safe Harbor
Researchers acting in good faith under these guidelines will not face legal action.  
However, any testing that causes service disruption, data exfiltration, or damage to infrastructure will be treated as **criminal activity** under international cybercrime laws.

## 5. Technical Security Standards

AniPortal.Live enforces the following mandatory security controls across all systems:

### 5.1 Network Layer Security
- All traffic must use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher).  
- HSTS is enabled with a one-year minimum duration.  
- All ports except 80 and 443 are closed by default.  
- Strict IP filtering for admin endpoints.  
- DDoS mitigation through geo-fencing and rate limiting.

### 5.2 Application Layer Security
- Input validation on every form, API, and parameter.  
- Automatic sanitization of HTML, JS, and user-generated content.  
- CSRF and XSS prevention enforced via HTTP headers.  
- SQL queries parameterized ‚Äî ORM injection strictly forbidden.  
- Dependency vulnerability scanning performed weekly.  
- No external scripts are permitted unless verified and cryptographically signed.

### 5.3 Authentication and Authorization
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) required for all privileged accounts.  
- Passwords must meet the following standard:  
  - Minimum length: 16 characters  
  - At least one uppercase, one lowercase, one number, and one symbol  
  - No dictionary words or reused credentials  
- Token-based authentication (JWT or OAuth2) with short expiry.  
- Sessions automatically expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.  
- Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced system-wide.  

### 5.4 Encryption
- All data at rest encrypted using **AES-256-GCM**.  
- All keys stored in Hardware Security Modules (HSM).  
- Secrets rotated every 90 days or immediately after any suspected breach.  
- Backup data encrypted and stored in separate geographic regions.

### 5.5 Logging and Monitoring
- 24/7 centralized logging of all server and application events.  
- Logs are immutable and stored for a minimum of 365 days.  
- Real-time intrusion detection system (IDS) and file integrity monitoring.
